# Working with data

This folder contains the completed files for the coding exercise of chapter 3. In this exercise, you finish building the bar graph started in chapter 2 while learning how to work with data in D3 projects.


## Techniques learned in this exercise

- Loading a dataset into a project using `d3.csv()`.
- Formatting the data in the callback function of `d3.csv()`.
- Finding the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.
- Generating DOM element with data-binding.
- Using D3 linear and band scales.
- Adding axis to a chart.


## Development environment

To run D3 projects, you'll need a web server. In chapter 1, we explained how to set up a local development environment using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and its [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

If you use this setup, you can start the project by clicking on the "Go Live" option in the status bar, located at the bottom of your VS Code window.

Happy D3 coding! ðŸ¤“
