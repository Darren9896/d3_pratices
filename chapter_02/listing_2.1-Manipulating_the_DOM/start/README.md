# D3.js in Action, 3rd Edition
## Chapter 2, listing 2.1

This folder contains the starter files for the coding exercise of chapter 2. In this exercise, you will start building a bar graph while learning how to manipulate the DOM with D3.


## Techniques learned in this exercise

- Selecting DOM elements with `d3.select()` and `d3.selectAll()`.
- Adding elements to a selection with the `selection.append()` and the `selection.insert()` methods.
- Setting and modifying the attributes of DOM elements with the `selection.attr()` method.
- Setting and modifying the styles of DOM elements with the `selection.style()` method.


## Development environment

To run D3 projects, you'll need a web server. In this chapter, we explain how to set up a local development environment using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and its [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

If you use this setuo, you can start the project by clicking on the "Go Live" option in the status bar, located at the bottom of your VS Code window.

Happy D3 coding! ðŸ¤“
